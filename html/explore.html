              We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
              Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
              experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we
              run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your
              age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new
              theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how
              you can join, send us a message.
